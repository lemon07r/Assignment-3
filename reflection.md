### Setting up tailwind
Fairly straight foward, this is something I have previous experience with too. I use the retro theme here since I feel it best matches the content that will populate our website. 

### Makinng the views
I use semantic html tags to help structure my html pages, then start to assemble parts of my view with daisyui components. 
We make two different drop down views, one for mobile, and one for desktop views, based on the viewport.
